                       <p>I do not know much about gods; but I think that the river<br />
Is a strong brown god - sullen, untamed and intractable,<br />
Patient to some degree, at first recognised as a frontier;<br />
Useful, untrustworthy, as a conveyer of commerce;<br />
Then only a problem confronting the builder of bridges.<br />
The problem once solved, the brown god is almost forgotten<br />
By the dwellers in cities - ever, however, implacable,<br />
Keeping his seasons and rages, destroyer, reminder<br />
Of what men choose to forget. Unhonoured, unpropitiated<br />
By worshippers of the machine, but waiting, watching and waiting.<br />
His rhythm was present in the nursery bedroom,<br />
In the rank ailanthus of the April dooryard,<br />
In the smell of grapes on the autumn table,<br />
And the evening circle in the winter gaslight.</p>

Eliot makes an explicit comparison between a river and the sea as models for the unknowable. A river, while it may figure prominently in human mythologies, is something that can eventually be crossed and conquered, while the sea represents an endless reserve of depths and mysteries: Man can live with the ocean but he will never master it.">The river is within us, the sea is all about us;</a><br />
The sea is the land's edge also, the granite<br />
Into which it reaches, the beaches where it tosses<br />
Its hints of earlier and other creation:<br />
The starfish, the horseshoe crab, the whale's backbone;<br />
The pools where it offers to our curiosity<br />
The more delicate algae and the sea anemone.<br />
It tosses up our losses, the torn seine,<br />
The shattered lobsterpot, the broken oar<br />
And the gear of foreign dead men. The sea has many voices,<br />
Many gods and many voices.<br />
 The salt is on the briar rose,<br />
The fog is in the fir trees.<br />
 The sea howl<br />
And the sea yelp, are different voices<br />
Often together heard: the whine in the rigging,<br />
The menace and caress of wave that breaks on water,<br />
The distant rote in the granite teeth,<br />
And the wailing warning from the approaching headland<br />
Are all sea voices, and the heaving groaner<br />
Rounded homewards, and the seagull:<br />
And under the oppression of the silent fog<br />
The tolling bell<br />
Measures time not our time, rung by the unhurried<br />
Ground swell, a time<br />
Older than the time of chronometers, older<br />
Than time counted by anxious worried women<br />
Lying awake, calculating the future,<br />
Trying to unweave, unwind, unravel<br />
And piece together the past and the future,<br />
Between midnight and dawn, when the past is all deception,<br />
The future futureless, before the morning watch<br />
When time stops and time is never ending;<br />
And the ground swell, that is and was from the beginning,<br />
Clangs<br />
The bell.<br />
</p>

                    <div id="poem">

                        <p>Where is there an end to it, the soundless wailing,<br />
The silent withering of autumn flowers<br />
Dropping their petals and remaining motionless;<br />
Where is there an end to the drifting wreckage,<br />
The prayer of the bone on the beach, the unprayable<br />
Prayer at the calamitous annunciation?</p>

<p> There is no end, but addition: the trailing<br />
Consequence of further days and hours,<br />
While emotion takes to itself the emotionless<br />
Years of living among the breakage<br />
Of what was believed in as the most reliable -<br />
And therefore the fittest for renunciation.</p>

<p> There is the final addition, the failing<br />
Pride or resentment at failing powers,<br />
The unattached devotion which might pass for devotionless,<br />
In a drifting boat with a slow leakage,<br />
The silent listening to the undeniable<br />
Clamour of the bell of the last annunciation.</p>

<p> Where is the end of them, the fishermen sailing<br />
Into the wind's tail, where the fog cowers?<br />
We cannot think of a time that is oceanless<br />
Or of an ocean not littered with wastage<br />
Or of a future that is not liable<br />
Like the past, to have no destination.</p>

<p> We have to think of them as forever bailing,<br />
Setting and hauling, while the North East lowers<br />
Over shallow banks unchanging and erosionless<br />
Or drawing their money, drying sails at dockage;<br />
Not as making a trip that will be unpayable<br />
For a haul that will not bear examination.</p>

<p> There is no end of it, the voiceless wailing,<br />
No end to the withering of withered flowers,<br />
To the movement of pain that is painless and motionless,<br />
To the drift of the sea and the drifting wreckage,<br />
The bone's prayer to Death its God. Only the hardly, barely prayable<br />
Prayer of the one Annunciation.</p>

<p> It seems, as one becomes older,<br />
That the past has another pattern, and ceases to be a mere sequence -<br />
Or even development: the latter a partial fallacy<br />
Encouraged by superficial notions of evolution,<br />
Which becomes, in the popular mind, a means of disowning the past.<br />
The moments of happiness - not the sense of well-being,<br />
Fruition, fulfilment, security or affection,<br />
Or even a very good dinner, but the sudden illumination -<br />
We had the experience but missed the meaning,<br />
And approach to the meaning restores the experience<br />
In a different form, beyond any meaning<br />
We can assign to happiness. I have said before<br />
That the past experience revived in the meaning<br />
Is not the experience of one life only<br />
But of many generations - not forgetting<br />
Something that is probably quite ineffable:<br />
The backward look behind the assurance<br />
Of recorded history, the backward half-look<br />
Over the shoulder, towards the primitive terror.<br />
Now, we come to discover that the moments of agony<br />
(Whether, or not, due to misunderstanding,<br />
Having hopes for the wrong things or dreaded the wrong things,<br />
Is not the question) are likewise permanent<br />
With such permanence as time has. We appreciate this better<br />
In the agony of others, nearly experienced,<br />
Involving ourselves, than in our own.<br />
For our own past is covered by the currents of action,<br />
But the torment of others remains an experience<br />
Unqualified, unworn by subsequent attrition.<br />
People change, and smile: but the agony abides.<br />
Time the destroyer is time the preserver,<br />
Like the river with its cargo of dead negroes, cows and chicken coops,<br />
The bitter apple and the bite in the apple.<br />
And the ragged rock in the restless waters,<br />
Waves wash over it, fogs conceal it;<br />
On a halcyon day it is merely a monument,<br />
In navigable weather it is always a seamark<br />
To lay a course by: but in the sombre season<br />
Or the sudden fury; is what it always was.</p>

                        <p>I sometimes wonder if that is what Krishna meant -<br />
Among other things - or one way of putting the same thing:<br />
That the future is a faded song, a Royal Rose or a lavender spray<br />
Of wistful regret for those who are not yet here to regret,<br />
Pressed between yellow leaves of a book that has never been opened.<br />
And the way up is the way down, the way forward is the way back.<br />
You cannot face it steadily, but this thing is sure,<br />
That time is no healer: the patient is no longer here.<br />
When the train starts, and the passengers are settled<br />
To fruit, periodicals and business letters<br />
(And those who saw them off have left the platform)<br />
Their faces relax from grief into relief,<br />
To the sleepy rhythm of a hundred hours.<br />
Fare forward, travellers! not escaping from the past<br />
Into different lives, or into any future;<br />
You are not the same people who left the station<br />
Or who will arrive at any terminus,<br />
While the narrowing rails slide together behind you;<br />
And on the deck of the drumming liner<br />
Watching the furrow that widens behind you,<br />
You shall not think 'the past is finished'<br />
Or 'the future is before us'.<br />
At nightfall, in the rigging and the aerial<br />
Is a voice descanting (though not to the ear,<br />
The murmuring shell of time, and not in any language)<br />
'Fare forward, you who think that you are voyaging;<br />
You are not those who saw the harbour<br />
Receding, or those who will disembark,<br />
Here between the hither and the farther shore<br />
While time is withdrawn, consider the future<br />
And the past with an equal mind.<br />
At the moment which is not of action or inaction<br />
You can receive this: &quot;on whatever sphere of being<br />
The mind of man may be intent<br />
At the time of death&quot; - that is the one action<br />
(And the time of death is every moment)<br />
Which shall fructify in the lives of others:<br />
And do not think of the fruit of action.<br />
Fare forward.<br />
 O voyagers, O seamen,<br />
You who come to port, and you whose bodies<br />
Will suffer the trial and judgement of the sea,<br />
Or whatever event, this is your real destination.'<br />
So Krishna, as when he admonished Arjuna<br />
On the field of battle.<br />
 Not fare well,<br />
But fare forward, voyagers.</p>

Those concerned with every lawful traffic<br />

Women who have seen their sons or husbands<br />

Or barbituric acids, or dissect<br />
The recurrent image into pre-conscious terrors -<br />
To explore the womb, or tomb, or dreams; all these are usual<br />
Pastimes and drugs, and features of the press:<br />
And always will be, some of them especially<br />
When there is distress of nations and perplexity<br />
Whether on the shores of Asia, or in the Edgware Road.<br />
Men's curiosity searches past and future<br />
And clings to that dimension. But to apprehend<br />
The point of intersection of the timeless<br />
With time, is an occupation for the saint -<br />
No occupation either, but something given<br />
And taken, in a lifetime's death in love,<br />
Ardour and selflessness and self-surrender.<br />
For most of us, there is only the unattended<br />
Moment, the moment in and out of time,<br />
The distraction fit, lost in a shaft of sunlight,<br />
The wild thyme unseen, or the winter lightning<br />
Or the waterfall, or music heard so deeply<br />
That it is not heard at all, but you are the music<br />
While the music lasts. These are only hints and guesses,<br />
Hints followed by guesses; and the rest<br />
Is prayer, observance, discipline, thought and action.<br />
The hint half guessed, the gift half understood, is Incarnation.<br />
Here the impossible union<br />
Of spheres of existence is actual,<br />
Here the past and future<br />
Are conquered, and reconciled,<br />
Where action were otherwise movement<br />
Of that which is only moved<br />
And has in it no source of movement -<br />
Driven by daemonic, chthonic<br />
Powers. And right action is freedom<br />
From past and future also.<br />
For most of us, this is the aim<br />
Never here to be realised;<br />
Who are only undefeated<br />
Because we have gone on trying;<br />
We, content at the last<br />
If our temporal reversion nourish<br />
(Not too far from the yew-tree)<br />
The life of significant soil.<br />
